# CDiscrodRP

CDiscordRP is a simple program that allows you to display your current game in your Discord profile.
This program is written in Java 17 and kotlin 1.7.21 and uses the Discord IPC, JavaFX, and AnimatesFX libraries.

This is rather a project for me to learn how to use JavaFX and Kotlin, instead of a serious project.
although you might see some feature is useless and not needed, but its fun to write these.

I build this during my free time, so I can't guarantee that I will update this project frequently.
